# Projeto-EDA-II
This is the second project of the course Algorithms and Data Structures. 
The second project is an improvement of the first one, instead of using arrays it's used linked lists.
There where some functionalities that the professor took off of the first one, but i left them here and added the new ones.
Everything the professor demanded was done.
Got a 17,5 - 18 out of 20 (still pending), not 20 because i did to many copies in the methods, and having a general tree instead of one for each station.
